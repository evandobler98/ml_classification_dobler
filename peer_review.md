# Peer Review: [classification_binware.ipynb](https://github.com/bware7/ml_classification_binware/blob/main/classification_binware.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization

The notebook is well-structured, with clear section headings that guide the reader through the project. Each step, from data loading to model evaluation, is logically ordered. However, adding a brief introduction at the beginning would provide better context for the reader.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification

The selected features are appropriate for the classification task. The use of domain knowledge in selecting features like odor and gill color is commendable. Including a rationale for each selected feature would enhance the reader's understanding of their relevance.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons

The notebook implements multiple classification models and provides performance metrics for each. The inclusion of accuracy scores and confusion matrices allows for easy comparison. To further strengthen this section, consider adding precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## 4. Reflection Quality

The reflections are thoughtful and provide insights into the model's performance and potential improvements. Discussing challenges faced during the project and how they were addressed adds depth to the analysis. Including specific examples of what could be explored in future work would make this section more actionable.
